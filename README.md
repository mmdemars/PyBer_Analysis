# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This project provides a summary of ridesharing data by city type over the scope of a four month period in order to provide buisness recommendations for the future. 

## Results
Urban ridesharing accounted for 63% of total fares, and 68% of total rides. Rural ridesharing while lessor is quantity, generally accounted for higher fares per ride - though with a much lower percentage of fares overall and rides overall.
-  Urban rideshares accounted for the vast majority of rides at 68.4%. Suburban rides accounted for 26.3%, and Rural rides accounted for 5.3%.

- Over 80% of all drivers were in the urban city type, with 16% in suburban cities, and only 2.6% in rural cities.

- 62.7% of the total fares were generated in urban cities, followed by 30% in suburban cities, and 6.8^ in rural cities.

![pyber summary df image here](https://github.com/mmdemars/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_Summary_df.png?raw=true)
- average fare per ride - The average fare for ride was 24.53 for urban rideshares, 30.97$ for suburban rideshares, and 34.62 for rural rideshares.
- average fare per driver - For urban ride shares, the average fare per driver was 16.57$, ising to 39.50% for suburban fares, and 55.49$ for rural fares.
- total fare by city type - Rural rideshares totaled $4,327.93 over four months, with suburban rideshares totalling $19,356.33, and urban rideshares totaling $39,854.38.

## Summary
Given the above statistics, we have the following recommendations:
- Increase the number of available driviers in rural cities. Rural citites saw high individual fares, and high fares per driver. The lack of available drivers could be creating lost revenue.
- Increasing the available drivers in suburban cities may help to increase those fare totals as those areas saw higher individual fares, and lower overall fares which could be a result of driver unavailability.
- Urban rideshares are doing well and no changes are recommended.
